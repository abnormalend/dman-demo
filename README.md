# Astro Website Demo

Welcome to your new Astro website! This project was set up with the base Astro static site generator.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ robots.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
