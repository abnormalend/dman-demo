Founder of The Engineering and Science Academy (TESA), Diallo focuses on empowering students to understand science and engineering through the practical application of mathematics. He develops pre-college curricula aligned with university expectations and advocates for computation and programming in K–12.

## Education

Diallo holds a B.S. in Electronics Engineering and a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Illinois, an M.S. in Astronautical Engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School, and an M.P.M. from Keller Graduate School. He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Engineering Education at Purdue University. He designed a comprehensive science and engineering curriculum spanning grades 6–12, with the high school sequence approved by the University of California A–G program, and has presented at ASEE on integrating computation and programming into K–12 as well as at NASA’s SEEC on applying the engineering design process and the mathematics behind Apollo 13.

## Space Camp

As an Analog Astronaut, Diallo participated in spacesuit evaluations at the University of North Dakota’s Inflatable Lunar and Mars Habitat (ILMAH) and served as Mission Commander at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station on Devon Island. He was selected as a NASA Airborne Astronomy Ambassador and flew aboard the SOFIA 747 flying observatory during a weeklong data collection mission. A proud Space Camp alumnus and advocate for educators and students, he was inducted into the Space Camp Hall of Fame in 2025.

## Military

Naval Aviator and Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer (NAVAIR Reserve Program). Diallo served in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the United States Naval Academy, teaching aeronautics, astronautics, and MATLAB programming. As Officer Representative of the 1,000‑member Naval Academy Flight Training Squadron (VTNA), he trained and mentored midshipmen preparing for flight school.

Reserve tours include Assistant OIC, NR Flight Test Augmentation Unit; Executive Officer, NR Joint Functional Component Commander for Space; and Administration Officer, NR Rapid Research and Development Unit. He is a member of the Defense Acquisition Corps (Level III Program Management) with advanced qualifications in Space Acquisitions and Space Operations, and has supported the Astronaut Office at Johnson Space Center.
